Congratulations, Mercury was successfully installed in your app. Documentation
and other useful info can be found at: https://github.com/mediatainment/mercury

Here's a post install checklist:

* Add and ENV Variable IMAGE_STORAGE_ENGINE with "fog" or "file"

* add //= require mercury # to your application.js

* DONT FORGET TO MIGRATE THE TB

* Adjust your application.js & css files to not `require_tree .`

* Learn about, and change configurations in app/assets/javascripts/mercury.js.

* If installed, you can make changes to the provided layout and css files too.

# mediatainment branch is not supporting paperclip out of the box (only carrierwave)

* If you want image processing and uploading (using paperclip by default):

  rails g mercury:install:images (use --orm=mongoid for MongoDB)
  bundle
  rake db:migrate (if using ActiveRecord)

* For a basic example of authentication for Mercury, install the example:

  rails g mercury:install:authentication
